				<h1>Getting started</h1>
			</div>
			<p>To use BlazingStars, first make sure that your PokerStars client is open.  You don't have to have any tables open, but the client has to be open or BlazingStars won't open (it'll give you an error message and shutdown).  BlazingStars will install an icon in your menu bar, as pictured below.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="../gfx/quickstartFig1.png" alt="Figure 1 - the BlazingStars menubar icon." />
			</p>

			<p>BlazingStars will attempt to auto-detect the PokerStars theme that you are using.  If you are using a theme that is currently not supported, BlazingStars will let you know and ask you to change it.  When you have selected a supported theme, you can ask BlazingStars to re-detect the theme by entering the preferences screen.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="../gfx/quickstartFig2.png" alt="Figure 2 - the BlazingStars preferences menu item." />
			</p>
	
			<p>Select the "Setup" tab, and click the "Redetect theme" button to force BlazingStars to detect the theme that you are currently using.  You may also wish to select a key combination to deactivate all the other hotkeys, which is especially useful for chat or note-taking if you use unmodified hotkeys (i.e. hotkeys with no Ctrl-, Alt-, or Cmd- modifiers).  </p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="../gfx/quickstartFig5.png" alt="Figure 5 - the BlazingStars setup tab." />
			</p>

			<p>BlazingStars comes with a set of default hotkeys, which you can use or change; you'll likely want to start on the "Basic Keys" tab.   Pictured below is a sample set-up that uses non-modified keys (i.e. no Cmd, Shift, Ctrl, or Opt keys).  Any modifier can be used in a hotkey combination - give it a try!</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="../gfx/quickstartFig3.png" alt="Figure 3 - the BlazingStars basic hotkeys setup." />
			</p>

			<p>After that, you may wish to set up some pre-configured bets in the Pot Bets tab. Click the icon for Pot Bets in the toolbar, and then you can choose up to four pre-configured bet sizes as a proportion of the current potsize on the table.  Pictured below is a configuration where Cmd-1 makes a quarter-pot bet, Cmd-2 makes a three-quarters pot bet, Cmd-3 makes a pot-sized bet, and Cmd-4 over-bets the pot by 50%.  Thus, if the pot was $100.00, Cmd-1 would bet $25.00, Cmd-2 would bet $75.00, Cmd-3 would bet $100.00, and Cmd-4 would bet $150.00.  If the "Automatically Click Bet Button" checkbox us <em>unchecked</em>, the bet will be entered into the bet box but you will have to click the Bet button yourself (or use one of the hotkeys you defined on the previous tab!).  You can also define a hotkey to make an all-in bet on this tab.  Finally, you can set automatic pre-flop raises.  If you like to raise 2.5, 3, or 4xBB pre-flop, you can ask BlazingStars to bet that amount and set a hotkey for each one.</p>

			</p>

			<p>These two tabs include most of the functions you will be using on a regular basis in BlazingStars, so close the preferences window and go play some poker!  If you play in a lot of Sit-N-Gos or regular tournaments, you might want to check out the <a href="openClose.html">Open:Close tab</a> as well, to handle some common annoyances of the PokerStars client.</p>
