			<p>BlazingStars is free software (free as in beer).  It costs you nothing to use, and there isn't even any of those annoying pop-up screens asking you to register.  However, creating BlazingStars costs time, and the only thing more valuable than money is time;  since I am a single hobbyist developer, responsible for every aspect of BlazingStars, time is my most precious and scarce resource.  If you would like to support the development and future improvement of BlazingStars, please consider donating through PayPal by <a href="http://www.fullyfunctionalsoftware.com/Fully_Functional_Software/Donate.html" title="Donations">visiting my website's donation page</a>.  Each donation buys me time, allowing me to continue developing BlazingStars and enhance the poker experience of Mac users. Thank you!</p>
